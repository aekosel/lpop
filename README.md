This repository contains code for the paper 'Semi-supervised Neighborhoods and Localized Patient Outcome Prediction'. The dataset used in the paper is not available for public distribution, so we include a similar, simulated dataset in addition to code for the R Shiny app. It can be run with the following commands:

<br />require(shiny)
<br />source("server.R")
<br />source("ui.R")
<br />runApp()
